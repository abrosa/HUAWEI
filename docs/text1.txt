Text 1 (15) complexity?

Topic description:
I have a very simple problem for you.
Given two integers A and B, your job is to calculate the Sum of A + B.

Requirement
time limitation: 1000 ms, memory limitation: 100 MB

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T (1 <= T <= 20) which means the number of test cases.
Then T lines follow, each line consists of two positive integers, A and B.
Notice that the integers are very large, that means you should not process them by using 32-bit integer.
You may assume the length of each integer will not exceed 1000.

Output
For each test case, you should output two lines.
The first line is "Case #:", # means the number of the test case.
The second line is the an equation "A + B = Sum", Sum means the result of A + B.
Note there are some spaces in the equation. Output a blank line between two test cases.
